This directory exists to store the various tables that hold the keybindings for each of the configured modes.

Move to modal keybindings has enabled me to more modularly and logically group the keybindings while also enabling an on screen display to remind me what the next keypress is. While more emacs like than I might otherwise prefer, the value exceeds the draw back in this case.
