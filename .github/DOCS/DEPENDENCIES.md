# DEPENDENCIES

The following packages are the `Void Linux` required packages. For other distros, obviously there will be other package names, as these are approached in a highly idiosyncratic way in the `Void Linux` repositories.

| Package          | Description                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- |
| `awesome-git`    | Must be built from source   |
| `xclip`          | clipboard for font awesome  |
| `goautolock`     | applying the lock screen    |
| `i3lock-color`   | the lock screen application |
| `greenclip`      | clipboard manager daemon    |
| `picom-ibhagwan` | Many compositing uses       |
