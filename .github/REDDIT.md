At long last, I present to you the flying spaghetti monster of code! My configuration of awesomewm that is the central project of the Electric Tantra Linux, my Artix variant that eases the installation/reinstallation of my environment on my various systems. 

## Environment 
Below are links to the relevant or otherwise interesting parts of the configuration depicted in this post. 

Feel free to borrow as you see fit, all I ask for is a star in the process (and a little credit doesn't hurt either)

### Mine 
- [// OS //](https://github.com/the-Electric-Tantra-Linux/electric-tantra-linux-iso) - The Electric Tantra Linux (WIP)
- [// WM //](https://github.com/the-Electric-Tantra-Linux/awesome) - AwesomeWM

### Not Mine

-[// Font: Goldman //](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Goldman) - one thing I have no interest in doing myself, making font-faces.

- [// Taglist Font //]() - released by the window manager itself




## Credit Where It is Due

To make this configuration took intense study of many other configurations. All of the listed projects and configurations that are part of my `awesome list` of `modular awesome configurations` [here]() deserve some varying degree of credit for code or inspiration, which I have tried to include in the comments in the various files that was inspired from an external source, but I am a human and there are a lot of files so forgive me if a reference or two were forgotten along the way. 

### Configurations I Found Especially Inspirational 

There are three configurations in particular I deserving being singled out as hugely inspiration for me: 

- [elenapan's configuration](https://github.com/elenapan/dotfiles)
- [manilarome's the-glorious-dotfiles](https://github.com/manilarome/the-glorious-dotfiles)
- [Tom Meyer's TOS Desktop Environment](https://github.com/ODEX-TOS/tos-desktop-environment)

The first two demonstrated to me as well as numerous others the potential of AwesomeWM to create modern UIs on the X11 desktop that were able to be fully crafted with an object oriented language. 

The third listed project, despite little recognition or currency in the ricing community, is a substantial effort that is by far one of the most robust efforts with creating a desktop environment out of the window manager. While its author and I differ in approach (and taste in logos), it has solutions to most of the issues one may encounter if trying to build out a desktop environment and is thus an invaluable resource (and worth ignoring that awful logo character).
