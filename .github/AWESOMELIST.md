<h1>Awesome Modular AwesomeWM Configurations </h1>

- [Configurations](#configurations)
- [Modules, Widgets & More](#modules-widgets--more)
- [That's All Folks!](#thats-all-folks)

---

## Rules

These are the rules for the inclusion of a configuration on the [Configurations](#Configurations) list below:

1. Must be a configuration of AwesomeWM or dotfiles containing as much
2. Must be more than the default rc.lua or single rc.lua + theme file(s). In other words, must have modules, widgets, etc in it.
3. Forks, credited or not, are welcome but must somewhat diverge from upstream source

#### Rules for Modules, Widgets & More

There really aren't any, I have included even very old, dormant projects which are still somewhat interesting. Since I definitely missed plenty, please submit pull requests or at least open issues, thanks!

# Modules, Widgets & More

Being that there is not another _active_ awesome list for awesomewm at present (the two dormant ones are listed below), there is need for a fresh collection of awesome modules, widgets and other awesome add-ins available on Github so those who don't obsessively research things can more easily find them.
