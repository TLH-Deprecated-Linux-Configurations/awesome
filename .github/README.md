<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>One of the features of this configuration, partially inspired by <i>Tom Meyers</i> who was inspired by the AwesomeWM developers themselves is that it is what I dub <i>semi-literate</i> in that unlike the often unreadable emacs configurations called <i>literate configurations</i> in which the actual configuration is being read from codeblocks in markdown files, I have opted to instead actually listen to the advise of so many programming tutorials and comment my code with enough description of what is going on that in a few months, returning to the same code, I am able to deduce what I was thinking personally. How this helps others understand the same snippet, I am not sure and will discover in time.</p>
<p>Unlike either Meyers or the AwesomeWM devs (who do a lot of pretty awesome work out of the kindness of their hearts, I deeply appreciate), I do not conform to a style of writing that code that <i>ldoc</i> can easily make into a wiki, which is a personal preference at its base as I have always found looking at the code and the comments at the same time more helpful personally and ultimately did intend the comments as a personal reference that in combination with a notion.so notebook help me answer the age old question of many developers looking at their own code and thinking <i>what the hell was I thinking?</i></p>
<p>If you would like to read additional information about this configuration, please see the ReadMe files in each of the subdirectories, where there are details about the directories content for the intrepid. </p>

<p>I have intensely evaluated and testing bits and pieces of over 100 separate modular awesome configurations in making this one, a real Frankenstein's Monster </p>

<p>Overall the most credit is due <i>elenapan</i>, <i>manilarome</i> and <i>Tom Meyers</i>. The first two because all the rest of you started with their configurations and hacked them into something unique and at times interesting, prone to fads I may act dismissive of but find interesting and appreciate your configurations of even if I try to inspire more from those showing its promise in the only way I know how</p>

<blockquote><small>Despite his on screen persona, R. Lee Emery was described by friends and family as a people person who took each of his actual recruits deaths, which during his stay in Manila he scanned for each morning going to the Hilton to get a copy of the magazine circulated among soldiers that listed those killed or injured while drinking his coffee and flirting with the waitress that would become his wife.</small></blockquote>

<p>My third ennumerated inspiration is being so enumerated in that when I have found myself unsure of a means of approaching an implementation or how some aspect of the API was working, I have found his work along similar lines extremely helpful in at minimum providing a starting place, though often approaching things differently to some degree. For being unknown among the <i> AwesomeWM on r/unixporn</i> crowd my talking up of his efforts springs from the magnitude of help his well commented and thorough efforts have helped me and which I am grateful the universe allowed me to find his repository and to him for putting all of the effort into writing it all out in the first place. </p>

<h4><b>But all of the many configurations I have combed over have some role in this one, you all deserve a lot of credit so I made a list ennumerating all of the configurations I have starred (hopefully,PR if your config complies but isn't listed and 100% of complying repos will become merged PRs)</b></h4>

<p>By making our work freely available, even to brag as is often it seems the only reason we display it publicly (and most give almost no credit to others they freely take from, cough cough) we are contributing to what makes Open Source an engine of growth for the tech sector in general even in our specific niche of a niche of a popularity/wallpaper contest niche.</p>
