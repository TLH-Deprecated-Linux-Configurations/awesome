These are the shell scripts useful to the configuration. Yes almost all of this could be written in lua but for one reason or another I have found increased functionality or ease of maintenance by writhing them in bash. DOn't worry, I will spare you from a laborious explanation of why they are better in BASH.

Below is a description of the scripts, mostly wrappers around single commands, with some notes explaining their functionality.

| Script | Notes |
|--------x-------|
| applauncher | the menu that comes up at pressing just mod4 |
| autorun | Similar to an ~/.xinitrc file, runs commands at startup |
| cpu | provides the cpu command called cpucmd for hardware monitoring |
| disk | Disk monitoring|
| emoji |provides the emojis for the emoji selection menu |
|getbrightness | Gets the brightness, one of the slicker features I have gotten to work mostly |
|ram | Hardware monitoring |
|setbrightness |sets the brightness (descriptive naming is key) |
| snapshot | screenshot script |
| wifi | provide wifi functionality via rofi |
