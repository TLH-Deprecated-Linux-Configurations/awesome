These are the shell scripts useful to the configuration. Yes almost all of this could be written in lua but for one reason or another I have found increased functionality or ease of maintenance by writhing them in bash. DOn't worry, I will spare you from a laborious explanation of why they are better in BASH.

Below is a description of the scripts, mostly wrappers around single commands, with some notes explaining their functionality.

| Script | Notes |
|--------x-------|
| applauncher | the menu that comes up at pressing just mod4 |
| autorun | Similar to an ~/.xinitrc file, runs commands at startup |
| cpu | provides the cpu command called cpucmd for hardware monitoring |
| disk | Disk monitoring|
|ram | Hardware monitoring |
| snapshot | screenshot script |
| wifi | provide wifi functionality via rofi |


## What Are the Other Scripts?!
Generated and used by hererocks for the local luarocks that is run to fully install the lua dependencies (since they are sort of necessary as well). 

That is explained elsewhere (hopefully) but if you are having trouble finding where, make an issue on the repo and I will assist you with that part.
