# Where Am I?

This directory is for the system bar at the bottom of the screen (hover to reveal) that is so ubiquitous on modern systems and is one of the more useful additions to the awesome environment as it prevents needing to bring this component in from an external program of dubious quality. Instead it is the same dubious quality as Awesome is.

## Subdirectories

1. old - contains the original system bar I have replaced entirely but am keeping around for now as its a useful reference.

2. widgets - components of the bar, separated from other widgets and the init file for simplicity's sake.
