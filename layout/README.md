# Layout

Here we assign the tiling layouts to the tags, calling on custom layouts found
in the `layouts` subdirectory (for want of a better name). The available custom
layouts provided by the `layouts` subdirectory are listed in a table below with
a brief explanation of the pattern they arrange the client windows in.

| Layout       | Arrangement                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| centermaster | master in the center and additional on the sides                                                                         |
| deck         | Overlapping clients arranged in a card-deck like manner, useful for switching between clients that are roughly maximized |
| empathy      | Stacks three on top, two on bottom                                                                                       |
| equalarea    | tiles clients with as equal screen geometry as possible and retaining usefulness when clients >5                         |
| horizon      | creates three rows of clients, like thrizen but horizontal                                                               |
| stack        | splits window in half and stacks additional windows on the right                                                         |
| thrizen      | three column layout                                                                                                      |
