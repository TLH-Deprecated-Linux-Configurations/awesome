# Project Log for 011 of Awesome
**Task 011**: reconsider the arrangement and placement of the centers, all of them, condense what can be condensed, rearrange, etc.
- in lieu of 010, consider moving all the centers into a combined center
- doesn't work with all of them, however connections and bluetooth can be merged and have been, 
  - everything for bluetooth button is left in place and a note in comment form is there to remind me, indicate to others 

## Or Nevermind Its Happening Anyway
- moving all centers to control center anyway, there is much to be gained this way 
  - made possible by including the overflow widget layout that adds a scrollbar to the widget (useful for most of the widgets which produce long output due to populating an array with a loop like network, bluetooth and especially notifications)
