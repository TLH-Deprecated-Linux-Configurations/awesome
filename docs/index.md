# AwesomeWM Configuration Wiki

This configuration is the showcase and center that the Electric Tantra Linux system is situated around. Being the same configuration I use extensively, as well as organically, that I've tired of reassembling just picture so I've created an ISO to streamline the process, serving in its capacity in that perfect union of Shiva and Shakti that is the Electric Tantra. While words cannot encompass the meaning of this most secret of tantras the seeker must discover within, the rest of the project lends itself to documentation easily enough so this wiki will serve as diamond vimana for such.

## About the Wiki

This wiki should help you understand exactly how to utilize the window manager that is the underpinning of the Electric Tantra Linux, including a brief overview of the concepts that underlie its features and functionalities that I found it necessary to first understand in writing the configuration itself. This will not be an exhaustive treatment of the subject as you can find reference manuals for those purposes easily enough nor will every feature find its way into these documents as the configuration is in a state of flux, that I have tried to constrain myself from altering too much too quickly but am human and prone to error so sometimes wiki treatment of somethings will be overlooked. I apologize in advance. 

The coming pages will introduce concepts that are important to understand in order to appreciate what this particular configuration is doing and why. I will assume you have a basic knowledge of Linux, but will still define certain key terms for the purposes of insuring the audience and I are on the same page regarding them. 

## About the Author

My name is Thomas Leon Highbaugh, the author of the Electric Tantra Linux and a Linux nerd of the worst sort who enjoys nothing more than making the sorts of attractive desktop layouts that I always wished were available on paid OSes I used before only to have found them here, in the Linux scrap heap. I also work in web development, employing the same questionable taste in making websites, which I make entirely on Linux in an environment configured to my precise taste and using the tools with configurations available to you on GitHub because its not like hiding those configurations would do anything but make it easier to loose them (and cause open source is good mmmkay?). 

## Influences
- **TDE** - Tom Meyer's awesome configuration that served as the basis/most major of influences on the present configuration. Absolutely most functional and fully featured Awesome configuration available on Github, even though it has the most annoying logo I have ever seen (its painful seriously)
- **Glorious Dotfiles** - inherited from Meyer's work. Great modular widgets and modules, terrible UI and questionable choices (titlebars on the left? really?)
- **Elenapan** - a great example of what can be done with awesome. Subdirectories are named some goofy things, but the code quality is generally high.

### Honorable Mentions:
-  **Awesome-Shell**  - recreation of ukde's look that effectively utilizes a single panel like this configuration
