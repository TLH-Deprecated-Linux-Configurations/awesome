# AwesomeWM Configuration Wiki

This configuration is the showcase and center that the Electric Tantra Linux system is situated around. Being the same configuration I use extensively, as well as organically, that I've tired of reassembling just picture so I've created an ISO to streamline the process, serving in its capacity in that perfect union of Shiva and Shakti that is the Electric Tantra. While words cannot encompass the meaning of this most secret of tantras the seeker must discover within, the rest of the project lends itself to documentation easily enough so this wiki will serve as diamond vimana for such.

## About the Wiki

This wiki should help you understand exactly how to utilize the window manager that is the underpinning of the Electric Tantra Linux, including a brief overview of the concepts that underlie its features and functionalities that I found it necessary to first understand in writing the configuration itself. This will not be an exhaustive treatment of the subject as you can find reference manuals for those purposes easily enough nor will every feature find its way into these documents as the configuration is in a state of flux, that I have tried to constrain myself from altering too much too quickly but am human and prone to error so sometimes wiki treatment of somethings will be overlooked. I apologize in advance. 

## About the Author

My name is Thomas Leon Highbaugh, the author of the Electric Tantra Linux and a Linux nerd of the worst sort who enjoys nothing more than making the sorts of attractive desktop layouts that I always wished were available on paid OSes I used before only to have found them here, in the Linux scrap heap. I also work in web development, employing the same questionable taste in making websites, which I make entirely on Linux in an environment configured to my precise taste. Welcome to the repo from which I exert the most control over that environment. 

## Influences

A huge debt is owed to Tom Meyers, who wrote TOS and the associated TDE that served as the primary inspiration for this configuration as well as the contributing much source code I've often modified to fit the needs of the present environment but still feel the need to reiterate that his work substantially helped me overcome a certain Lua writing block I had fallen into, especially true because he wrote great commentary to go with a remarkably well put together configuration that I found highly instructive and advanced beyond others I have seen by orders of magntitude. 

With that comes the influence the Glorious Dotfiles played upon Meyer's work, which he attributes a similar reverence for even if its present form is not as functional as that at the core of TOS. While introducing its own set of quirks, the files that make up that giant in the world of AwesomeWM configurations provide much of the functionality needed to turn AwesomeWM into what is more of a DE than a WM. 

Elenapan is also a huge influence in the ways her configuration seamlessly finds a place and function for the personal touches and polish the average user expects. Her work has also inspired many to dive deeply into the possibilities of Linux customization, helping keep the community vibrant and active enough to keep AwesomeWM's development team working on the project. 

Finally to the author of Awesome-Shell who showed how simplicity in complex configurations can be readily achieved and convinced me I need only one panel
