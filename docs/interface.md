p# Using the Interface

One particularly popular AwesomeWM configuration declares in a rebel tone that it is mouse drive, which puts it in opposition to the typical key driven pattern of usage that is employed by tiling window managers and the configurations of such found on Github. This configuration is not meant for puritans, it is meant for me and as I always say:

I agree, luckily the Lua this configuration had to be written in did give me the ability to
