# Using the Configuration

The easiest and most consistent way to appreciate this configuration as I do, is by trying out the Electric Tantra Linux either as a VM or Live USB. This insures you will have the prerequisite packages already installed, the components of the configuration in full working order and all of the advantages that come with my dotfiles in general and this configuration specifically. However, if you are not interested in such, just replace the contents of the `.config/awesome` directory with the content of this repository and refresh AwesomeWM. If you have installed all the prerequisites, it should load just fine (no promises, its fickle due to its size).

## Prerequisite Packages

You will need to install the following packages, which are listed as they appear in the Arch Repositories and AUR. For other distros, we will have to await the possibility of someone using them to provide an adapted package list.
