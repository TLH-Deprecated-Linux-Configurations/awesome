# Externals

As implied in the section describing the subdirectories within the configuration, several external programs are utilized to provide specific functionality either outside the scope of the window manager, not easily reproduced within Lua (or the context of AwesomeWM) or because I have not gotten around to writing them in AwesomeWM compatiable Lua script. What these programs are, which exceed the title merely of dependencies, as well as what they are configured specifically here for and why I have opted to include their configurations is recorded below so as to best clue my audience as to why I have made the decisions I have in the process of building this configuration with a hope that they may begin to address the matter of their own configuration with at least my experience to serve as some sort of rough guide even if by negative example.

## Picom: Specific Fork and Application in Context

No piece of software from outside of the AwesomeWM itself is as indispensible as the picom X compositor that provides a set of effects to X11 based Window Managers such as rofi that adds in a lot of functionality either in rough form in the window manager itself, or wholly outside of its scope due to the structure of the X11 windowing system which is beginning to be replaced by still occupies the dominant position within the world of Linux windowing systems. Picom enables me to add in effects and functionality that make the otherwise somewhat aged AwesomeWM environment and make it akinenti to a more modern DE such as Gnome or XFCE, even to the level which Apple and Microsoft's paid alternatives provide (albeit with substantially less overhead meaning the hardware need not be as expensive to achieve these results), which effectively can be reduced to rounding window corners, adding window transparency and blurring the wallpaper behind the semi-transparent window in addition to a few other useful functions.

Specifically, the picom fork being used in the configuration is known on the AUR as `picom-jonaburg-git` and it provides patches in addition to picom's usual offerings both the dual_kawase blur and rounded corners in an altogether highly stable release I rarely have had trouble with. While it may seem strange that such features contribute much to how modern a GUI looks and feels, the importance can hardly be over stated as these features contribute some qualitative but very real elements to the configuration that I could at best roughly emulate imperfectly with the Window Manager itself in some of their cases.

## Rofi: Flexible Dmenu Replacement

The other highly important, though rather easily replaced with AwesomeWM specific code to a varying degree of achieving the precisely identical effects, is the functionality provided by Rofi. With its modified dialect of CSS used to configure its menus, I am able to realize a system application menu akin almost precisely to the look of Gnome that with a few keybindings I am able to realize one of the few hold over preferences I have from Windows, hitting the <kbd>mod4</kbd> key and typing an application name with a quick enter and the application opening. While also available via Gnome, the process is hardly smooth and that particular DE tends to want you to use its software store for whatever reason meaning I oft found myself opening that instead of the desired program.

Rofi provides other functionality, such as a menu of Font Awesome icons, the selected icon being copied to the clipboard, which is highly useful in both Linux and web development contexts that I have found indispensible since first seeing a recipe for such I ultimately modified for inclusion at the press of <kbd>mod4</kbd> + <kbd>F4</kbd>. 

# Vice Color Scheme 

As this configuration is a testament to how over the top I will go with optimizing every possible variable of my system, I made a `base16` color scheme called `vice` (named for Miami Vice) that is used through out the configuration as sourced in modified form from the `.Xresources.d/color` file that is included with my personal dotfiles. The thought behind the theme was choosing gray tones tending towards blue and complementary white tones that together:
    1. Don't hurt my eyes at all, unlike `gruvbox` maybe I am a vampire but I have no issues with blue light on my screens at night. 
    2. Match one another well and without being too jarring 
    3. Enable using a mid-tone gray text on the dark background that comes default (making your eyes feel way better than anything redshift does)
    4. Uses vibrant colors to visually cue the eye that are distinct and in between pastel and neon, preventing eye strain 

This color scheme is the product of hours of color modification and testing, paid for in blood by me and subject to slight modifications randomly as I am optimizing it to be the optimal scheme that literally **no base16 scheme actually is** that mixes stylish tones and provides a dark background without being unpleasant to look at. 

Most of the applications I use that have the ability to detect the `.Xresources` file apply this scheme's modification for that format, which I tend to prefer over taking the time to rewrite the scheme for various programs. Thus I save time if I change a color, as the change is reflected without additional tinkering with my dotfiles when set up this way. Thus most applications fit within the general UI look and feel of the configuration, which I find a much more pleasant way to use my system than have `Atom One` on VSCode, `God-Only Knows Sythwave Inspired Vim Theme` & `Tomorrow Night Hideous Theme for Kitty`

## Dhumavati GTK3 Theme && Chhinamasta Icon Theme 

Paired with this configuration is a GTK theme I made that styles all of the windows in `the Electric Tantra Linux` and has some pretty nifty features like gradients on active elements of the window's bottom border. This is not just some Oomox variant either, the GTK theme is rendered out of SCSS because while I deeply loved Oomox while new at the whole ricing thing, I have specific enough tastes and needs now as to only be properly satisfied with creating even more work for myself and maintaining a theme entirely myself.

To go with it, I also have an icon theme, which conforms mostly to the `vice` scheme as well, that I cobbled together out of a litany of icon packs. A few of the icons are wholly my own design (like Firefox after tiring of that awful orange in their branding)
