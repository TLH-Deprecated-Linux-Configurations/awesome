# Externals

As implied in the section describing the subdirectories within the configuration, several external programs are utilized to provide specific functionality either outside the scope of the window manager, not easily reproduced within Lua (or the context of AwesomeWM) or because I have not gotten around to writing them in AwesomeWM compatiable Lua script. What these programs are, which exceed the title merely of dependencies, as well as what they are configured specifically here for and why I have opted to include their configurations is recorded below so as to best clue my audience as to why I have made the decisions I have in the process of building this configuration with a hope that they may begin to address the matter of their own configuration with at least my experience to serve as some sort of rough guide even if by negative example.

## Picom: Specific Fork and Application in Context

No piece of software from outside of the AwesomeWM itself is as indispensible as the picom X compositor that provides a set of effects to X11 based Window Managers such as rofi that adds in a lot of functionality either in rough form in the window manager itself, or wholly outside of its scope due to the structure of the X11 windowing system which is beginning to be replaced by still occupies the dominant position within the world of Linux windowing systems. Picom enables me to add in effects and functionality that make the otherwise somewhat aged AwesomeWM environment and make it akin to a more modern DE such as Gnome or XFCE, even to the level which Apple and Microsoft's paid alternatives provide (albeit with substantially less overhead meaning the hardware need not be as expensive to achieve these results), which effectively can be reduced to rounding window corners, adding window transparency and blurring the wallpaper behind the semi-transparent window in addition to a few other useful functions.

Specifically, the picom fork being used in the configuration is known on the AUR as `picom-jonaburg-git` and it provides patches in addition to picom's usual offerings both the dual_kawase blur and rounded corners in an altogether highly stable release I rarely have had trouble with. While it may seem strange that such features contribute much to how modern a GUI looks and feels, the importance can hardly be over stated as these features contribute some qualitative but very real elements to the configuration that I could at best roughly emulate imperfectly with the Window Manager itself in some of their cases.

## Rofi: Flexible Dmenu Replacement

The other highly important, though rather easily replaced with AwesomeWM specific code to a varying degree of achieving the precisely identical effects, is the functionality provided by Rofi. With its modified dialect of CSS used to configure its menus, I am able to realize a system application menu akin almost precisely to the look of Gnome that with a few keybindings I am able to realize one of the few hold over preferences I have from Windows, hitting the <kbd>mod4</kbd> key and typing an application name with a quick enter and the application opening. While also available via Gnome, the process is hardly smooth and that particular DE tends to want you to use its software store for whatever reason meaning I oft found myself opening that instead of the desired program.

Rofi provides other functionality, such as a menu of Font Awesome icons, the selected icon being copied to the clipboard, which is highly useful in both Linux and web development contexts that I have found indispensible since first seeing a recipe for such I ultimately modified for inclusion at the press of <kbd>mod4</kbd> + <kbd>F4</kbd>.
