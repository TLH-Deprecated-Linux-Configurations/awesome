# Libraries

A common feature of many modern AwesomeWM configurations is the presence of one or several libraries which add important functionality onto the window manager as supplemental to its core libraries included by default with the installation of the application. This configuration is no different, using several published libraries that are common faire in the configurations available via `r/unixporn` for public appreciation, as well as known versions of the core libraries of the window manager and a library composed of files inherited but unmodified from the source code that has undergone rather extensive, radioactive mutation since beginning its life within to become the configuration it now is. 

## Known Versions of Core Libraries?

Why did I include known versions of the core libraries within the configuration itself, especially consider AwesomeWM is lucky to have annual updates as if it was a version of Debian? To put it simply, if not in a manner off the cuff to no small measure, I did so because AwesomeWM is fickle garbage ultimately. While incredibly extensible garbage, it is still a semi-neglected monster akin to that of Dr. Frankenstein's misunderstood beast without any of Mary Shelley's incredible writing or imaginings of it having finer sensibilities at its core. Thus, I have had times where seemingly vital libraries that absolutely were available to Awesome in its corresponding entry in `/usr` still threw an error as if it was not there, which I placated by including the library within the `.config/awesome` directory with the rest of my configuration and so have made a habit of including these libraries just in case. This is also true of several other libraries available via AUR for system-wide installation, which are also liable to make Awesome throw a lua fit at the most inopportune times, which has hindered me enough that I simply avoid the potential pitfall entirely by including a version I know will work in the first directory the single threaded Window Manager even bothers to look in so I won't have any problems when desperately recovering from a reinstallation hours before an interview or whatever other means of providing guru discipline Linux has in store for me next. 

## Third Party Libraries: Those Used and the Philosophy At Play

While having nothing but gratefulness and awe at the sacrifices made by various groups of interested people at providing additional AwesomeWM functionality for free to the public, I will preface this whole section by stating my long term intention is to strip out these fruits of group labor from this configuration as soon as the fates will allow me. Being that for now, the additional functionality is necessary as packaged by these wonderful and generous benefactors, I have also settled on using known versions of each that I keep in the `lib` directory as some of them introduce changes they may break no one else's configuration but at the size that mine has grown to, sometimes changing comments too radically causes a previously unforeseeable error to bubble up to the surface and as the developers are occupied elsewhere, filing issue reports and awaiting a solution is a little naive while making pull requests based on my hacky, often specifically personal, adaptations to these errors would not serve the community at large as their idiosyncratic nature will often preclude them from being merged anyway. Thus I prefer eschewing submodules in this case, which gives me the freedom to tinker with the code without loosing that work, as these files placed where they are thus are considered by my version control and my changes are enduring, as is their stability, even if tinkering with optimizing the performance of my system leads me to breaking my install and forcing me to reinstall everything including the configuration. 

Of most critical importance at present to this configuration is the `bling` library that provides the default layout used in this configuration called `mstab`. While I have no use for any of its other functionality, such as tiled wallpaper and some interesting sounding but for my purposes not wholly useful alternative layouts that others may appreciate in their own workflow and are thus encouraged to check out on their own, I find the manner of bisecting the screen in two halves, with the right stacking additional windows arranged via a `tabbar` the most ergonomic means of using a tiling window manager without needing to constantly fuss with it upon opening a new window (which is a process I dislike needing to contend with in sway/i3 especially). When time and my energy levels permit, I hope to port in this functionality into the configuration and eliminate the unnecessary code that while unused and thus not contributing performance lag, is still clutter in an already cluttered configuration that is unlikely to soon need to have window swallowing (another horrid name from the `ricing` community) available at hand for any reason. 

I also make extensive use of `vicious` to provide polling data from the underlying system which I like to have available as one never knows when some modification will melt their cpu, be it AwesomeWM related or due to some other tinkering with the Linux kernel itself that is the culprit, knowledge is (saved) power. Available upon pressing the widgets on the left panel displaying this information are graphs derived from the excellently documented `awesomewm-widgets` by `streetturtle` that is a beacon of literate hope in the generated documentation desert that AwesomeWM evidently became starting with version 4.0 and before I found myself scratching my head trying to make sense of module documentation on its wiki. These two graph popups give a visual representation of processor load (and processes causing said load) and memory usage that I find helpful to get a complete picture if necessary without needing to open `htop` and try to keep my eyes on the same item hopping around the screen with each cycle. These may not be wholly essential functions to others, but they provide me with information I find very helpful in tasks like creating this monster of a configuration. 

`lib-tde` are the modules emerging from the more ambitious effort by Tom Meyers called TDE that this configuration began its life as. Despite some rather substantial modifications, which fused what was intended to be several programs running as a desktop environment into just an AwesomeWM configuration with a lot less user controls exposed (as I never need to tinker with them, thus have no need for the potential debugging surface they expose), I still find many pieces of Meyer's code base useful and have not had the need to modify them substantially enough to take over the additional maintenance that moving them into the general configuration would ultimately entail.
