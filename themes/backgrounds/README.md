# backgrounds

the files in this subdirectory are the included wallpapers, which I prefer to
call backgrounds, some of which are my own work while others are from third
parties. While having lost the links, and unwilling to search Wallhaven, a
tedious and time consuming process as that is, I have merely indicated the
sources until such time as Google eases their image search functionality with
Linux and dragging and dropping doesn't just mean an hour of waiting and the
page to error out.
