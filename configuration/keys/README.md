# Configuration/Keys

This subdirectory is for the keybindings applied at the root level, which apply regardless if their is a focused client or not and are unrelated to the client keys for that reason. This includes application launchers, various means of working with multiple clients and litany of useful or vital functions for my operation of the window manager as my daily driver.
