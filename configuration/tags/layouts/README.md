# Configuration/Tags/layouts

Yes, these are custom layouts, which are inspired by the noted projects in each
file. Like much else about this configuration, I have preferred to take
ownership of the code so that I could

    a. format the files to my liking
    b. modify the code to best fit into this configuration
    c. stabilize and ease maintence
